# Explanation
Since the case study is simple, I reused a project that I had already done. The project is a simple delivery system that allows the user to create an order and track it. I had deleted mostly everything that was not necessary for the case study, only keeping the project structure.
In this case study, I just used one ModelViewSet to managing the tasks. You can check it in `develivery-server/delivery/services.task` directory. The model is in `develivery-server/delivery/models.py` file.
I recommend using the docker installation but you can use the local installation if you want. The docker installation is more straightforward and you don't need to worry about the dependencies.

# Install guide

## Local installation

### Virtual environment

Create a virtual environment and active with the following command:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate # Windows

```

### Install dependencies

```bash
cd delivery-server
pip install -r requirements.txt
poetry install
```

### Run the server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

## Docker installation (Recommended)

```bash
docker-compose up
```

# Migration

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

# API Documentation and testing
If you are using the docker installation, you can access the API documentation in the following link: [http://localhost:8000/docs/](http://localhost:8000/docs/)

# Improvements
Since the case study is simple, I think I can't add any improvements about optimize the API or database design.
For extending the project, I would add a user authentication for the API and make some relationships between users and tasks. (eg. a user can only see their tasks, or a user can assign a task to another user.). I would also add a queue system to manage the tasks and a notification system to notify the user about the task status or remind them about the deadline. This would make the project like other task management systems like Trello or Asana. ðŸ˜‚
